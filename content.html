      <h2>About Our Community</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Latinx Gamers — a space created by and for gamers who want more from their campus experience. Founded by Latinx students at UCI, our community was built in response to the lack of visibility and support for diverse gaming interests in existing campus clubs. While UCI’s Esports Arena offers great resources, its focus tends to lean toward competitive team shooters, leaving out many other genres that are equally beloved—such as Otome, Gacha, and RPGs. These types of games, popular among many students from underrepresented communities, are often overlooked or even hidden due to stigma. We’re here to change that. Latinx Gamers is a welcoming and inclusive online community centered on shared love for all kinds of video games. Whether you’re into story-driven romance games, strategic mobile titles, or immersive role-playing adventures, you’ll find a place here. Our website offers a judgment-free space to connect with others, discover game recommendations, join events, and talk freely—anonymously if you prefer. Though rooted in supporting the Latinx community, everyone is welcome. We believe that gaming is for all—and through it, we can build stronger, more inclusive connections at UCI. Game on, together.
